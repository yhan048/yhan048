- 👋 Hi, I’m Yupeng@Trifo (yhan048)
- 👀 I am an R&D engineer with experience in computer vision and its application in robotics. (Previously worked as a research assistant at CMU RI [SBPL], I also hold an M.S. MechE degree in Purdue and B.S. MechE degree at SJTU).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning SLAM and sensor fusion, searching for feasible scene understanding algorithms that these day's robots can use.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
  - how to develop a scene understanding system that can be applied in consumer electronics products.
  - how to combine scene understanding(perception) with SLAM.
  - how to develop a system that can cope with perception, SLAM, and planning.
  - how to use a limited budget to build a fancy autonomous robot.
